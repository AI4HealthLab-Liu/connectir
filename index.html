        <p>Connectir is an R package principally for conducting a Connectome-Wide Association Study (CWAS) using Multivariate-Distance Matrix Regression (MDMR). CWAS with MDMR attempts to find regions of the brain with functional connectivity patterns that are significantly associated with a phenotype. For instance, if you have two groups (ADHD and Controls) and each subject has a resting-state fMRI scan, then CWAS-MDMR would find brain regions whose connectivity patterns significantly differentiate the two groups. Further post-hoc analyses such as seed-based correlation analyses would be needed to discern the specific connections and direction of the group difference.</p>

<p>On this page, we show how to install the connectir package and associated command-line scripts (Section 1). Then, we will give a brief tutorial on how to run a vanilla CWAS analysis with our code and leave the details for our wiki (Section 2). Finally, we have links to our publications and conference presentations (Section 3). Please <a href="zarrar.shehzad@yale.edu">contact me</a> if you have any questions.</p>

<p>I give a quick option first and then describe some other options for the install.</p>

<h2>
<a name="quick-approach" class="anchor" href="#quick-approach"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quick Approach</h2>

<ol>
<li>Install <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">R</a>) and optionally <a href="http://www.rstudio.com">Rstudio</a>.</li>
<li>Install the relevant packages within R including connectir using my script <a href="https://github.com/czarrar/Rinstall/blob/master/connectir_install.R">connectir_install.R</a>.</li>

<p>There are two ways to parallelize the analyses. One approach is to divide your workflow into smaller chunks and run those separately (like separate processes). This comes with the R packages installed with <a href="https://github.com/czarrar/Rinstall/blob/master/connectir_install.R">connectir_install.R</a>. Another approach is to run each matrix algebra operation (e.g., dot product) in parallel, which go into detail in this section. There's a whole section in the official <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-admin.html#Linear-algebra">R Installation and Administration</a> page about linking to different linear algebra routines. Below I'll go through the different options and the best ones I found.</p>

<p>You can do your own install of R. For instance, you can use the binaries on the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">main R website</a>. I would also recommend installing <a href="http://www.rstudio.com">Rstudio</a>, which is a GUI that wraps around R and makes it more interactive like matlab. You can also install R via my own script that links R with a parallel matrix algebra library called openblas. This script is in the <a href="http://github.com/czarrar/Rinstall">Rinstall repo</a> and is called <code>install.py</code>.</p>

<p>After R is setup, there are several packages within R that need to be installed. To do this, please run <a href="https://github.com/czarrar/Rinstall/blob/master/connectir_install.R">connectir_install.R</a>.</p>
