{"name":"Connectir","tagline":"R package for Connectome-Wide Association Studies","body":"Connectir is an R package principally for conducting a Connectome-Wide Association Study (CWAS) using Multivariate-Distance Matrix Regression (MDMR). CWAS with MDMR attempts to find regions of the brain with functional connectivity patterns that are significantly associated with a phenotype. For instance, if you have two groups (ADHD and Controls) and each subject has a resting-state fMRI scan, then CWAS-MDMR would find brain regions whose connectivity patterns significantly differentiate the two groups. Further post-hoc analyses such as seed-based correlation analyses would be needed to discern the specific connections and direction of the group difference.\r\n\r\nOn this page, we show how to install the connectir package and associated command-line scripts (Section 1). Then, we will give a brief tutorial on how to run a vanilla CWAS analysis with our code and leave the details for our wiki (Section 2). Finally, we have links to our publications and conference presentations (Section 3). Please [contact me](zarrar.shehzad@yale.edu) if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nI give a quick option first and then describe some other options for the install.\r\n\r\n## Quick Approach\r\n\r\n1. Install [R](http://cran.r-project.org)) and optionally [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com).\r\n2. Install the relevant packages within R including connectir using my script [connectir_install.R](https://github.com/czarrar/Rinstall/blob/master/connectir_install.R).\r\n\r\n## Details and Troubleshooting\r\n\r\n### Parallel Matrix Algebra Operations\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to parallelize the analyses. One approach is to divide your workflow into smaller chunks and run those separately (like separate processes). This comes with the R packages installed with [connectir_install.R](https://github.com/czarrar/Rinstall/blob/master/connectir_install.R). Another approach is to run each matrix algebra operation (e.g., dot product) in parallel, which go into detail in this section. There's a whole section in the official [R Installation and Administration](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-admin.html#Linear-algebra) page about linking to different linear algebra routines. Below I'll go through the different options and the best ones I found.\r\n\r\n#### Intel MKL\r\n\r\nYou can do your own install of R. For instance, you can use the binaries on the [main R website](http://cran.r-project.org). I would also recommend installing [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com), which is a GUI that wraps around R and makes it more interactive like matlab. You can also install R via my own script that links R with a parallel matrix algebra library called openblas. This script is in the [Rinstall repo](http://github.com/czarrar/Rinstall) and is called `install.py`.\r\n\r\n## Installing Connectir and Other R Packages\r\n\r\nAfter R is setup, there are several packages within R that need to be installed. To do this, please run [connectir_install.R](https://github.com/czarrar/Rinstall/blob/master/connectir_install.R).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
