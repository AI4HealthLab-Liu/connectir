{"name":"Connectir","tagline":"R package for Connectome-Wide Association Studies","body":"Connectir is an R package principally for conducting a Connectome-Wide Association Study (CWAS) using Multivariate-Distance Matrix Regression (MDMR). CWAS with MDMR attempts to find regions of the brain with functional connectivity patterns that are significantly associated with a phenotype. For instance, if you have two groups (ADHD and Controls) and each subject has a resting-state fMRI scan, then CWAS-MDMR would find brain regions whose connectivity patterns significantly differentiate the two groups. Further post-hoc analyses such as seed-based correlation analyses would be needed to discern the specific connections and direction of the group difference.\r\n\r\nOn this page, we show how to install the connectir package and associated command-line scripts (Section 1). Then, we will give a brief tutorial on how to run a vanilla CWAS analysis with our code and leave the details for our wiki (Section 2). Finally, we have links to our publications and conference presentations (Section 3). Please [contact me](zarrar.shehzad@yale.edu) if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nI will be using two files from the [Rinstall github repository](http://github.com/czarrar/Rinstall) here. There are two steps in the installation:\r\n\r\n1. Install R\r\n2. Install the relevant packages within R including connectir\r\n\r\n## Install R\r\n\r\nYou can do your own install of R. For instance, you can use the binaries on the [main R website](http://cran.r-project.org). I would also recommend installing [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com), which is a GUI that wraps around R and makes it more interactive like matlab. You can also install R via my own script that links R with a parallel matrix algebra library called openblas. This script is in the [Rinstall repo](http://github.com/czarrar/Rinstall) and is called `install.py`.\r\n\r\n## Installing Connectir and Other R Packages\r\n\r\nAfter R is installed, there are several packages within R that need to be installed.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
