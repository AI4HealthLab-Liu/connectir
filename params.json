{"name":"Connectir","tagline":"R package for Connectome-Wide Association Studies","body":"# About\r\nConnectir is an R package principally for conducting a Connectome-Wide Association Study (CWAS) using Multivariate-Distance Matrix Regression (MDMR). CWAS with MDMR attempts to find regions of the brain with functional connectivity patterns that are significantly associated with a phenotype. For instance, if you have two groups (ADHD and Controls) and each subject has a resting-state fMRI scan, then CWAS-MDMR would find brain regions whose connectivity patterns significantly differentiate the two groups. Further post-hoc analyses such as seed-based correlation analyses would be needed to discern the specific connections and direction of the group difference. The CWAS-MDMR results simply tell you which regions have a significant connectivity effect.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
