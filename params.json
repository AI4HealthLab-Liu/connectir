CWAS-MDMR attempts to find regions of the brain with connectivity patterns that are significantly associated with a phenotype. For instance, if you have two groups (ADHD and Controls), then CWAS-MDMR would find regions whose connectivity patterns significantly differentiate between the two groups. Further analyses such as seed-based correlation analyses would ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
